# Envato XPerience

A Chrome extension that enhances the Envato browsing experience with cleaner previews, preserved product context, optional live-demo helpers, and marketplace UI cleanup tools.

## Features

- **Auto-Remove Mode**: Automatically removes preview frames on visit (enabled by default).
- **Floating Control Panel**: A sleek, non-intrusive side panel with a focused Status view and a broader Admin view.
- **Premium UI**: "Glassmorphism" design with smooth, switch-like animations.
- **Context Preservation (Floating Widget)**: Optionally injects an elegant floating button panel on the creator's real external website, retaining Envato's "Buy Now" and "Details" links even after the redirect.
- **Hide Ads Toggle**: Optionally suppresses major Envato promotional surfaces such as top banners, Elements cross-sells, footer promos, marketplace switcher ads, `top-sellers` author sidebars, and account/download promos.
- **Hide Removed Items**: Optionally compacts deprecated/removed items in your Downloads page into elegant, sleek action bars. Offers Just-In-Time thumbnail extraction on hover, native fallback certificate downloads, and instant DOM cleanups.
- **Stable Product Identity**: Uses the canonical Envato `itemId` from `/item/.../<id>` URLs so product data stays aligned across item, reviews, comments, and support tabs.
- **Local Image Cache**: Stores product hero images in `IndexedDB` with TTL and eviction rules instead of bloating extension storage.
- **Contextual Status States**: Outside item pages, the panel switches to premium editorial states for browse, preview, and fallback contexts instead of showing a dead loading message.
- **Compact Product Card**: The sidepanel now renders a tighter, Envato-inspired product card with title, author, category, price, sales, rating, last update, and direct live preview access.
- **Support Section**: The Admin tab includes a lightweight funding card with GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee, and PayPal support options for independent development.
- **Smart Detection**: Specifically extracts product metadata from Envato domains and targets the `.full-screen-preview__frame` container safely.
- **Shadow DOM Isolation**: The UI and floating widgets are strictly encapsulated in Shadow DOM to avoid CSS bleeding onto any theme's complex stylesheets.

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvuljevas/envato-xperience.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `envato-xperience` folder.

## Usage

- **Auto-Remove**: Just browse Envato network sites (ThemeForest, CodeCanyon, VideoHive, etc.). Preview wrappers can redirect you directly into clean live demos.
- **Floating Control Panel**: Click the extension icon to toggle the floating panel on any Envato page. From there, you can:
    - Open the live preview directly from supported preview pages.
    - Use `Status` for the current marketplace or product context.
    - Use the `Admin` tab for core and enhancement controls such as **Auto Remove**, **Floating Widget**, **Hide Ads**, and **Hide Removed Items**.
    - Open the bottom gear-powered **Settings** surface inside `Admin` for `About` and `Support`.

## Technical Details

- **Manifest V3**: Compliant with the latest Chrome Extension standards, utilizing `chrome.storage.local` context passing mechanisms and full domain permissions `<all_urls>` for cross-origin widget injection.
- **Architecture**:
    - `envato-shared.js`: Shared helpers for Envato host detection, canonical `itemId` parsing, site naming, and settings compatibility/migration.
    - `marketplace-init.js`: Early `document_start` bootstrap that mirrors the `Hide Ads` setting into the page root before the marketplace paints, using both extension storage and a per-host `localStorage` mirror to reduce first-paint flicker.
    - `marketplace-overrides.css`: Declarative anti-flicker stylesheet that collapses supported Envato ad surfaces immediately when `Hide Ads` is enabled, including shared browse/category sidebars and downloads/account promo rails.
    - `content.js`: Captures Envato metadata on previews, uses Envato `itemId` as the stable product key, fires secure redirects, and injects floating Shadow DOM widgets into third-party target showcase websites.
    - `removed-items.js`: Isolated DOM-safe transformer for unavailable downloads, including compact action bars, JIT thumbnail hydration, and lightweight downloads-list observation.
    - `content.css`: Base layout requirements for the floating panel.
    - `assets/`: Shared UI assets grouped into `fonts/`, `images/`, and `icons/`.
    - `sidepanel.html/css/js`: An aesthetic UI implementation loaded inside an isolated inner iframe, with a compact Status view, an Admin control surface, and a bottom-triggered Settings sub-view.
    - `image-cache.js`: `IndexedDB`-backed image cache with checksum, TTL, and eviction rules for product artwork.
    - `background.js`: Event handler orchestration (relaying extension clicks).

## Compliance

- The extension is packaged as a self-contained Manifest V3 project with no remote JavaScript.
- The panel typography is bundled locally, including `Oswald`, with no remote font dependency.
- Product metadata is rendered using safe DOM APIs rather than `innerHTML`.
- Cached product images are stored in `IndexedDB`, not `chrome.storage.local`.
- Envato ad suppression is applied through packaged `document_start` CSS and a lightweight local bootstrap with a host-level mirror, reducing visible flicker without remote dependencies.
- Compliance notes and pre-publish review guidance live in `docs/COMPLIANCE.md`.
- Cache architecture and storage rationale live in `docs/IMAGECACHE.md`.

## Development

### Smoke Automation

For repeatable local smoke checks, the repo now includes a Playwright-based extension runner:

```bash
npm install
npm run smoke:extension
```

What it does:
- launches Chromium with the unpacked extension loaded from the repo
- uses a standard persistent profile directory at `.playwright/chrome-extension-dev`
- opens the floating panel through a small DOM test bridge in `content.js`
- validates `Hide Ads` on supported item, browse, and `top-sellers` pages
- validates authenticated account/download views using `/.env.local`, including fallback navigation through the user popover when needed

Useful overrides:
- `PLAYWRIGHT_EXTENSION_PROFILE_DIR`: reuse an existing Chrome/Chromium dev profile instead of the default local profile
- `PLAYWRIGHT_EXTENSION_PATH`: override the unpacked extension path
- `SMOKE_ITEM_URL`: override the item-page smoke URL
- `SMOKE_TOP_SELLERS_URL`: override the browse/top-sellers smoke URL

Notes:
- The baseline smoke currently passes `item page`, `top-sellers`, and authenticated `downloads`.
- Reusing a real Chrome profile works only when Chrome is not already holding the same root user-data directory lock.
